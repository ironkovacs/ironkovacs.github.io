			<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
			<p>During the university years I was working as a surveyor, draftsman, part-time dog trainer and graphic designer.</p>
			<p>After graduating as a construction manager, I started to work as a building site project manager in the technology piping
				industry. At my previous job my motivation dropped as I wasn't able to use my creativity. So I started to seek for new
				opportunities to improve myself. As I was always interested in IT technologies and computer science it was clear that
				Greenfox was able to give this chance. I realized in the learning process that I’m mostly interested in front-end, UI,
				UX development, but due to my previous studies and jobs I’m also interested in building management systems and smart
				home applications.
			</p>
			<h3>Strengths :</h3>
			<p>I like challenges, so I’m ready to take on bigger tasks. I’m able to quickly adopt to new environments. Due to my good
				communication skill, I am able to speak out for the team. According to my teammates I’m able to think complexly and critical
				about a whole project.</p>
			<h3>Skills to improve: </h3>
			<p>I have a tendency to getting lost in the details of something less important, because of this I need to improve in setting
				the right priorities. Accept the guidance of the PO, even if I do not agree with it. Ask for and accept assistance from
				my teammates.</p>
			<h3>Insights</h3>
			<p>I work best when I have a challenging work environment, with a supportive team and team lead.
			</p>
			<p>What I want most in my next job is to be creative and constructive, where the opportunities are given to improve myself
				both in intellectual and technical fields</p>
			<p>The biggest motivation for me is to accomplish a challenging task, to create something, as a member of a productive team,
				where I can use my creativity</p>
			Next thing I want to learn
			<p>I would like to deepen my front-end / full-stack knowledge, mostly interested in TypeScript, JavaScript, but there are
				several technologies to explore. I would like to acquire knowledge in languages like Python and C#, frameworks like React,
				Angular, and AWS based smart home systems.
